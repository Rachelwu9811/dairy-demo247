                    <p>The first day you left Taiwan. I'm trying so
                            hard to get aquaint with your absence. I went
                            to the river bank where we spent most of our
                            time there. Every fraction of the sceneries at
                            Meiti looks slightly different, a little alienated,
                            a little unfamiliar, a little darker as well.
                            Without clouds covering, fishes jumping,
                            pedestrians jogging, the unusual silence
                            picturized my lonelyness. Therefore, I sent you
                            the email for outlet, getting the encouragement
                            rightafter. All the positve promises you've
                            made are to of the promount importance to me.
                            Instead of mourning, I gather the strength and
                            turn it into the blessings, hope you can do well
                            in the new city.

                    <p>Torn by the weekly meeting, but I was actually
                        really productive by giving copious pinpoint
                        advices, collecting overriding figures of our
                        web, and pointing out the clear guideline of
                        future direction to follow. I took saveral bites of
                        toast before my workout. It has literally been a
                        while for me to rebuild my jogging habit, so
                        instead of my 5 km goal, I started with 4.
                        Actually, I found I haven't lost my stamina at
                        all. 4 km for Rache is quite easy yet still got me
                        sweat. It was windy today. Even with the
                        hoodie, I found the wind blew through every
                        inch of my skin, maybe the troublesome
                        thoughts as well. BTW I'm craving for making
                        a beeline for your hug.

                    <p>I got the notification form my dad this evening
                        that due to the overbooked ticket issue, I might
                        only have slight chance to enjoy the aboard
                        experience which I'm so long for with you.
                        Suddenly, I was swamped by the pessimistic
                        thoughts, so dreadful that I can't even speak a
                        word for over an hour. Thankfully, I was beaten
                        but not broken. Focusing on blanket searching
                        an alternative, I was trying to rearrange the
                        budget of travelling spendings. I would say, it
                        was your repondings that ease off my anxiety
                        all the time, while sometime I don't know how
                        to express my gratefulness. Hope the subtitue
                        plan can work out in the end. Hitherto I've
                        never stopped missing you btw.

                    <p>After the suffering Tuesday, all things with
                        regard to the works went pretty smoothly, not
                        extremely buzy, or facing Ding Dong, the
                        handful one. I went on a dinner plan at La
                        Mesa w my, I would say, currently congenial
                        collegue. We also invited a doctor as well. For
                        the suggestion proposed by the doctor, we
                        ordered a bottle of sangria which is kinda the
                        most popular signature at here. The warmess
                        smelling of cinnamon enmated the soothing
                        vibes where I let go all of the stress from
                        working days. I was not overtook with the
                        drink, while just imaging if u were here, all
                        things could have become the best. Let's keep
                        moving forward toward the promising one!

                    <p>It was the day that we started our video
                        chitchat via tne Net. The typical Rache, always
                        talks about everything she wants drove you into
                        tears again. Hope you feel better afterward.
                        Just sharing my opions toward the philosophy
                        that I stick to for I can see you becoming a
                        better person all the time. I was, am and will
                        not try to make you become the person I like,
                        but just enjoying seeing us growing together.
                        Before going to sleep, I was little axious about
                        the first weekend being alone actually. I hope
                        tomorror can be as productive as it was before.
                        BTW I still have no idea why I was so fatigue
                        on Friday. Maybe the workout? Closing my
                        eyes, I had slipped into unconsciousness.

                        the very last episode of Lucifer (So Romantic),
                        Studying finance in the afternoon, and baking
                        new bagels, I also went out with ChiaHow this
                        evening for sukiyaki and some drinks. We had a
                        great time together like usual, sharing our
                        recent lives, and relationships( he was so mean
                        that he said my situation of relationship is
                        called Schrodinger's relationship!Nevermin-

                    <p>It's the end of the first week. I wrote you a
                        email today, hoping to make it into a cycled
                        rouitne where I can summarize my week, my
                        thoughts, my love as well. I'm getting myself
                        busy to make the day productive. I don't wanna
                        waste the extra time when you are not by my
                        side physically. Instead of being a goof-off, I'd
                        like to improve myself by soaked in the
                        knowledge sea where I am a chubby little
                        spinge. I grabbed my GRE books, finance one,
                        and spent my half of my day studying after
                        being a grocery shopper in the afternoon.
                        Actually, I felt the mentally fulfillment. I think
                        I'm really in love with learning new knowledge.
                        Hope you can feel that way while studying.

                    <p>In the beginning, I was wondering how was
                        your day, Willy? Did things go well and
                        smoothly? Eventully, I think that'll become a
                        redundency because you are independent
                        enough. On the other hand, I seriously don't
                        wanna become a mama type girlfriend..
                        Liberty and independence are all I'm searching
                        for in a health realtionship. Therefore, rather
                        than caring too much, I chose to let you share
                        your day with me. BTW we booked the
                        tranfering plane ticket today after toss and
                        turned for several days bothered by the ticket
                        issue. I'm so grateful by your help mentally,
                        physically or financially. Starting to looking
                        forward to the days spending in cities abroad!

                    <p>Still a long & ordinary Tuesday, and I am so occupied by 
                        the weekly meeting. Even though, in the beginning, I though 
                        it would be a short one due to little events to be updated. 
                        To be honest, I wrote the diary couple days after today because 
                        being snowed under all the future planning project. However 
                        I did not feel the actual inner fulfillment cuz being starving 
                        for being more capable of data analysis. Therefore, I made 
                        up my mind to invest more time on self study, and also that is 
                        another reason why I had no time to write you a dairy for days. 
                        Well, let us just look on the bright side that we all imrpove

                        Being the type of person daulting awkwardness, to level 
                        with you, I was so not looking forward to the event on 
                        Wednessday. Yet, life is a box of chocolate; you never
                        know what you gonna get. My eventful day turned 
                        out to be a incredible one where I enjoyed chichatting 
                        with the bartender, having dinner with my colleague. 
                        Whats more, the urologist also gave me three bottles 
                        of gin that I favored. I will definately make cuppa 
                        gin tonic in the near future. A great conversation unfurled
